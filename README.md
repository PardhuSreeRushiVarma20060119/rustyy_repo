## 🎯 Learning Objectives

This repository tracks my journey in learning Rust, focusing on:

1. **Ownership System** - Understanding Rust's unique memory management
2. **Type Safety** - Leveraging Rust's strong type system
3. **Concurrency** - Safe concurrent programming
4. **Error Handling** - Robust error management with Result and Option
5. **Zero-Cost Abstractions** - Writing high-level code that compiles to efficient machine code

## 🔑 Key Rust Concepts Mastered

### ✅ Fundamentals
- Variables and mutability (`let`, `mut`, `const`)
- Data types (primitives, compound types)
- Functions and expressions
- Control flow (if, loop, while, for)
- Comments and documentation

### ✅ Ownership & Borrowing
- Ownership rules
- References and borrowing
- Mutable vs immutable references
- Move semantics
- Clone and Copy traits

### 🔄 In Progress
- Advanced traits and generics
- Lifetime annotations
- Smart pointers (Box, Rc, RefCell)
- Concurrency patterns
- Async/await programming

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Rust toolchain installed (rustc, cargo)
- Text editor or IDE (VS Code with rust-analyzer recommended)

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/PardhuSreeRushiVarma20060119/rustyy_repo.git

# Navigate to the repository
cd rustyy_repo

# Run rustlings exercises
cd rustlings
cargo run

# Run individual projects
cd ../guessinggame
cargo run
```

## 📖 Learning Resources Used

- [The Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) - Interactive exercises
- [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)
- Official Rust Documentation

## 🛠️ Projects Breakdown

### Completed Projects
- ✅ Hello Rust - Basic syntax
- ✅ Guessing Game - User interaction and control flow
- ✅ Euclidean Algorithm - Mathematical computations
- ✅ Loop Exercises - Iteration patterns

### Rustlings Progress
- ✅ Introduction & Setup
- ✅ Variables (variables1-6)
- ✅ Functions (functions1-5)
- 🔄 Control Flow (if statements)
- 🔄 Primitive Types
- 🔄 Move Semantics

## 💡 Key Takeaways

1. **Immutability by Default** - Rust variables are immutable unless explicitly marked with `mut`
2. **Explicit Type Annotations** - Function parameters require explicit types
3. **Expression-Based Language** - Functions return the last expression automatically
4. **Memory Safety Without GC** - Ownership system prevents memory errors at compile time
5. **Helpful Compiler** - Rust's compiler provides detailed, actionable error messages

## 🎓 Skills Developed

- Writing safe, concurrent code
- Understanding memory management without garbage collection
- Debugging with Rust's helpful compiler messages
- Problem-solving with Rust's type system
- Building efficient command-line applications

## 📈 Future Goals

- [ ] Complete all rustlings exercises
- [ ] Build a CLI tool with clap
- [ ] Create a web service with Actix/Axum
- [ ] Implement data structures from scratch
- [ ] Contribute to open-source Rust projects
- [ ] Learn async programming with Tokio
- [ ] Explore embedded Rust programming
